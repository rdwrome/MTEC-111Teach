# [Scientifically-Proven Teaching Strategies](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008090)
- Teachers are trying to build confidence to support future learning
- Learners can't self-assess, don't have correct self-perceived ability
  - ["imposter"](https://www.webmd.com/balance/what-is-imposter-syndrome)
  - ["dunning-kreuger"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect)
- Teacher is NEVER starting from scratch! Teacher's job is to fit information into the learner's existing mental model, about their *pre*conception of what the learner is learning about.
- [Expert awareness gap](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/04-expertise.html#:~:text=Experts%20face%20challenges%20when%20teaching,overcome%20our%20expert%20awareness%20gaps.)
- Never speak ill of other tools
- Formative assessment: a moment of reflection to focus attention and avoid cognitive overload, helps place in long-term memory
- ONLY 5-7 concepts before formative assessment! (maximum 15 min)
- Examples of formative assessment:
  - 'what questions do you have?'
  - faded in questions (basically fill-in-the-blank)
  - 'has everyone completed this task with me?'
- Group work whenever possible! (also helps with long-term memory)
