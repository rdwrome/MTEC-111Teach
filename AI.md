## AI according to AI Folks in 2024
- "Science of Making Machines Smart" - Demis Hassabis (Google DeepMind)

## Uncanny Valley
- Robots: OK, Humans: OK. Can't tell? NOT OK
- [Cats (2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtSd844cI7U)
- [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/)
- The concept of "Smart" is **socially-constructed** ('beauty is in the eye of the beholder'... so is 'smart')

## "AI" vs "Machine Learning" according to AI folks
- Make a machine do something 'smart,' automatically adapt to users, provide them unique experience
- Early methods include **Logic or Expert Systems**
  - Creator of the system 'solves' the problem in advance
  - [DeepBlue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer))
  - Can't deal with the unexpected, can't learn anything new
- **Machine Learning**
  - System can learn new things
  - [AlphaGo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo)

  - but can it learn **beyond its training data**?

### Types of Machine Learning
  - Supervised (training data has all the answers)
  - Unsupervised (anomaly detection)
  - Semisupervised (partially-labelled, looking for patterns)
  - Reinforcement learning (like training a dog with positive and negative rewards, who has helped Google Translate?)

### Modes
  - Batch learning (you get all the training data at once)
  - "Online" learning (system can accept new training data on the go)
  - Instance-based (commits training data to memory, then compares new data to training data)
  - Model-based (generalizes from a set of examples then uses that model to make predictions)

### Problems
  - Insufficient quantity of training data
  - Poor quality of training data
  - Non-representative training data

**Ethics**
- Where is training data coming from?
- Is it enough? Is it high quality? Is it representative?
