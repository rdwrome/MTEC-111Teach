## AI according to AI Folks in 2024
- "Science of Making Machines Smart" - Demis Hassabis (Google DeepMind)

## Uncanny Valley
- Robots: OK, Humans: OK. Can't tell? NOT OK
- [Cats (2019)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtSd844cI7U)
- [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/)
- The concept of 'smart' is **socially-constructed** (e.g. 'beauty is in the eye of the beholder'... so is 'smart')

## "AI" vs "Machine Learning" according to AI folks
- Make a machine do something 'smart,' automatically adapt to users, provide them unique experience
- Early methods include **Logic or Expert Systems**
  - Creator of the system 'solves' the problem in advance
  - [DeepBlue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer))
  - Can't deal with the unexpected, can't learn anything new
- **Machine Learning**
  - System can learn new things
  - [AlphaGo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo)
  - [BINA48](https://www.hansonrobotics.com/bina48-9/)
  - [chatGPT](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/15/magazine/ai-language.html?searchResultPosition=2)
  - but can it learn **beyond its training data**?
- **Artificial General Intelligence? Artificial Super Intelligence?**
  - **can** learn beyond its training data
  - not "here" yet

### Types of Machine Learning
  - Supervised (training data has all the answers)
  - Unsupervised (anomaly detection)
  - Semisupervised (partially-labelled, looking for patterns)
  - Reinforcement learning (like training a dog with positive and negative rewards, who has helped Google Translate?)

### Modes
  - Batch learning (you get all the training data at once)
  - "Online" learning (system can accept new training data on the go)
  - Instance-based (commits training data to memory, then compares new data to training data)
  - Model-based (generalizes from a set of examples then uses that model to make predictions)

### Problems
  - Insufficient quantity of training data
  - Poor quality of training data
  - Non-representative training data

**Ethics**
- Where is training data coming from?
- Is it enough? Is it high quality? Is it representative?

## Berklee AI Policy
'Policies around the use and incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) will vary, and students should refer to syllabi and/or their course instructors for policies specific to their class or to specific assignments. In the absence of a policy or direction from the instructor specifically permitting the use of AI, using AI to substantially complete coursework—either directly or with modification—and presenting it as original work constitutes a violation of academic integrity and will be treated analogously as receiving help from another person. Students with questions about the use of AI or academic integrity should check with their instructor before submitting work.'
